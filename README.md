# Isaac Newton Project

XML(TEI) code representation of one of manuscripts written by genius medieval scientist Isaac Newton in digital form.

This project was created by Patrycja Karolina Pietras and [Anton Persianov](https://github.com/antonpersi) as the final output of the Text Encoding and Digital Scholarly Editing course held at Ca' Foscari Venice University by Professor Franz Fischer.

# Content

This folio is an extract of an eleven-page tract representing Newton's attempt to provide a synopsis of his early alchemical reading, and to come up with what is, essentially, a "theory of everything," namely a physical theory that unifies and accounts for all known natural phenomena.
