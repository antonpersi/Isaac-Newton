XML(TEI) code representation of [one of manuscripts](https://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/newton/html/metsnav3.html#mets=http://purl.dlib.indiana.edu/iudl/newton/mets/ALCH00081&page=1) written by genius medieval scientist Isaac Newton in the digital form.

This project was created by Patrycja Karolina Pietras and [Anton Persianov](https://github.com/antonpersi) as the final output of the Text Encoding and Digital Scholarly Editing course held at Ca' Foscari Venice University by [Professor Franz Fischer](www.unive.it/persone/franz.fischer).

# Content

This folio is an extract of an eleven-page tract representing Newton's attempt to provide a synopsis of his early alchemical reading, and to come up with what is, essentially, a "theory of everything," namely a physical theory that unifies and accounts for all known natural phenomena.
